## CipherTextProgram 
Introduction
----------------

The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the simplest method of encryption technique. Itâ€™s simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.


Algorithm for Caesar Cipher:
Input:

A String of lower case letters, called Text.
An Integer between 0-25 denoting the required shift.
Procedure:

Traverse the given text one character at a time .
For each character, transform to encrypted format the given character 
Return the new string generated.
